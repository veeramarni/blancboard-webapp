					<strong><span>Blancboard, Inc.</span></strong> (&quot;we&quot; or &quot;us&quot;) seeks to safeguard your privacy and secure your information
					during your visit to our web site and your use of our web site services. This privacy policy outlines our practices for collection, use and
					disclosure of the information that you provide to us through this web site. By visiting this web site or using our services, you consent to the
					procedures and practices discussed in this policy. We may, from time to time, change this privacy policy, so please check it regularly for any
					changes or updates. If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, then you may email us at info@Blancboard.com.<br /> <br /> <strong><span>Key
							Terms </span></strong><br /> Throughout this privacy policy we use several specialized terms. When we use the term &quot;Personally Identifiable
					Information&quot; in this privacy policy, we mean information that is specific to you as an individual, like your name, email address,
					residential address, telephone number, facsimile number, employment history and other biographical information, compensation and other employment
					related information and credit card information. The term &quot;User Information&quot; incorporates all of your Personally Identifiable
					Information and any other forms of information discussed in this privacy policy. We use the term &quot;aggregate&quot; to indicate our
					combination of information from various persons or users. Information is said to be &quot;anonymized&quot; if it does not identify individual
					persons or entities, or associate a particular person or entity with such information.<br /> <br /> <strong><span>Information
							Collection, Use and Disclosure Practices </span></strong><br /> When visiting our web site to browse or use our services, you may choose certain on-line

					provided to the website; (iii) download any stored information related to one or more Applications or other stored data; (iv) perform one or more
					additional data transfer functions related to information stored on the website; or (vii) to contact us. <br /> <br /> (a) Browsing Our Web

					you are using, and the particular web site pages you view, the date and time you access our sites, your authenticated user name and referring
					Internet address (including key words used in the search engine). We may use this information to improve our site and user experience. We may
					also share this information with third parties if we choose to aggregate and disclose site traffic information for marketing or commercial
					purposes. <br /> <br /> (b) Using Our Services. When you engage in any of the aforementioned on-line options or use any other features of our
					web site services, you provide us certain Personally Identifiable Information. We collect and store this Personally Identifiable Information, any
					updates to such information that you send us, and any modifications that we make to such information. Except as set forth in this policy, we will
					not reveal any such Personally Identifiable Information, including, without limitation, your resume or other employment related information, to
					any other third party without your consent, except that we may share User Information with our business associates who assist us in administering
					our services or web site. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, we may use, disclose or transfer certain User Information (a) to provide you the services
					or information you request; (b) to send you marketing materials, newsletters or information about our services and any updates thereto; (c) to
					protect the confidentiality or security of your records; (d) to comply with law enforcement, governmental mandate, or other legal requirement if

					disclose or create derivative works from Feedback without acknowledgement or compensation to you.<br /> <br /> <strong><span>Cookies</span></strong><br />
					We may employ cookies (e.g., small text files) that our web site may send to your browser for storage on your hard drive. We may use such cookies
					to make use of our site easier by saving your status and preferences upon visits to our site. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies,
					but you may be able to change the settings to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you choose to modify your settings
					to reject cookies, then it may affect your use of our web site.<br /> <br /> <strong><span>Revise Your Information</span></strong><br /> If
					you use our services or web site, then you have voluntarily consented to our information collection, use and disclosure practices as described in
					this privacy policy and other written documentation that may be provided to you regarding the services or web site. If you would like to modify
					information about you that we or other third parties may view through our web site, then please update your information through your account

					from us.<br /> <br /> <strong><span>Control of Your Password </span></strong><br /> To help secure User Information, we designed a password
					protected system. We will never ask for your password or user identification in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Except as
					specifically permitted by this privacy policy or other instructions regarding the use of our web site or services you may not, and will ensure
					that you do not, lend, give, or otherwise disclose any passwords or user identifications to any unauthorized person, or permit any unauthorized
					person to use your accounts, related passwords or user identifications. Any loss of control of passwords or user identifications may result in
					the loss of control over Personally Identifiable Information. You will be responsible for any actions taken on your behalf or any person using
					your passwords or user identifications. If passwords or user identifications have been compromised for any reason, then you should immediately
					notify us so that we may issue you new passwords or user identifications.<br /> <br /> <strong><span>Third Party Web Sites </span></strong><br />
					You may have the option to enter third party web sites through our web site or you may have the option to enter our web site from another third
					party web site. Since we cannot be assured that such third party web sites follow our privacy policies, we encourage you to ask questions and
					review the privacy policies of these third parties. We have no responsibility or liability for the actions or policies of these independent
					sites, do not endorse any product or service that may be mentioned or offered in such sites, and are not responsible for the content or privacy
					practices of such sites.<br /> <br /> <strong><span>Children's Privacy </span></strong><br /> Children under the age of 18 will require their

					<span>Blancboard Terms of Service </span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b><span>1. Your relationship with Blancboard</span></b>
					<span>
						<br /> Your use of Blancboard's products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the &quot;Services&quot; in this document) is
						subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Blancboard. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of
						the terms of that agreement. The terms of this agreement form a legally binding agreement between you and Blancboard in relation to your use of
						the Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the
						&quot;Terms&quot;.<br /> <br /> <b>2. Accepting the Terms</b> <br /> In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You may not use
						the Services if you do not accept the Terms. You can accept the Terms by:
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						(A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by Blancboard in the user interface for any Service; or<br />
						(B) by actually using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree that Blancboard will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of
						the Terms from that point onwards.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Blancboard, or (b) you
						are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are
						resident or from which you use the Services. Before you continue, you should print off or save a local copy of the Universal Terms for your
						records.<br /> <br /> <b>3. Provision of the Services by Blancboard</b> <br /> Blancboard is constantly innovating in order to provide the best
						possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which Blancboard provides may change from
						time to time without prior notice to you. As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that Blancboard may stop (permanently
						or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally at Blancboard's sole discretion, without
						prior notice to you. You may stop using the Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform Blancboard when you stop using the
						Services. You acknowledge and agree that if Blancboard disables access to your account, you may be prevented from accessing the Services, your
						account details or any files or other content which is contained in your account. You acknowledge and agree that while Blancboard may not
						currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of storage
						space used for the provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may be set by Blancboard at any time, at Blancboard's discretion.<br /> <br />
						<b>4. Use of the Services by you</b> <br /> In order to access certain Services, you may be required to provide information about yourself
						(such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the Service, or as part of your continued use of the
						Services. You agree that any registration information you give to Blancboard will always be accurate, correct and up to date.<br /> You agree to
						use the Services only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the Terms and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or
						guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States or other
						relevant countries). You agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of the Services by any means other than through the interface that is
						provided by Blancboard, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Blancboard. You specifically agree not to
						access (or attempt to access) any of the Services through any automated means (including use of scripts or web crawlers) and shall ensure that
						you comply with the instructions set out in any robots.txt file present on the Services. You agree that you will not engage in any activity that
						interferes with or disrupts the Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Services). You agree that you will not
						reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade or resell the Services for any purpose. You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Blancboard
						has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the Terms and for the consequences (including any
						loss or damage which Blancboard may suffer) of any such breach.<br /> <br /> <b>5. Your passwords and account security</b> <br /> You agree and
						understand that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of passwords associated with any account you use to access the Services.
						Accordingly, you agree that you will be solely responsible to Blancboard for all activities that occur under your account.&nbsp; If you become
						aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify Blancboard immediately at support@Blancboard.com.<br /> <br />
						<b>6. Privacy and your personal information</b> <br /> For information about Blancboard's data protection practices, please read Blancboard's
						privacy policy at http://www.Blancboard.com/privacy.html. This policy explains how Blancboard treats your personal information, and protects your
						privacy, when you use the Services. You agree to the use of your data in accordance with Blancboard's privacy policies.<br /> <br /> <b>7.
							Content in the Services</b> <br /> You understand that all information (such as data files, written text, or other information) to which you may
						have access as part of, or through your use of, the Services are the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated. All
						such information is referred to below as the &quot;Content&quot;. You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Blancboard has no responsibility
						to you or to any third party for) any Content that you create, transmit or display while using the Services and for the consequences of your
						actions (including any loss or damage which Blancboard may suffer) by doing so.<br /> <br /> <b>8. Proprietary rights</b> <br /> You
						acknowledge and agree that Blancboard owns all legal right, title and interest in and to the Services, including any intellectual property rights
						which subsist in the Services (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist). Nothing
						in the Terms gives you a right to use any of Blancboard's trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand
						features.<br /> <br /> <b>9. License from Blancboard</b> <br /> Blancboard gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and
						non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Blancboard as part of the Services as provided to you by Blancboard (referred to as the
						&quot;Software&quot; below). This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Blancboard, in
						the manner permitted by the Terms. You may not (and you may not permit anyone else to) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse
						engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the Software or any part thereof, unless this is expressly permitted or
						required by law, or unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by Blancboard, in writing.<br /> <br /> <b>10. Content license
							from you</b> <br /> You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in Content or any applications which you submit, post or display on
						or through, the Services. By submitting, posting or displaying the Content or applications you give Blancboard a perpetual, irrevocable,
						worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and
						distribute any Content or applications which you submit, post or display on or through, the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of
						enabling Blancboard to display, distribute and promote the Services and may be revoked for certain Services as defined in the Additional Terms of
						those Services. You agree that this license includes a right for Blancboard to make such Content or applications available to other companies,
						organizations or individuals with whom Blancboard has relationships, and to use such Content or applications in connection with the provision of
						those services.<br /> <br /> You understand that Blancboard, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users,
						may (a) transmit or distribute your Content or applications over various public networks and in various media; and (b) make such changes to your
						Content or applications as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to the technical requirements of connecting networks, devices,
						services or media. You agree that this license shall permit Blancboard to take these actions.<br /> You confirm and warrant to Blancboard that you
						have all the rights, power and authority necessary to grant the above license.<br /> <br /> <b>11. Software updates</b> <br /> The Software
						which you use may automatically download and install updates from time to time from Blancboard. These updates are designed to improve, enhance and
						further develop the Services and may take the form of bug fixes, enhanced functions, new software modules and completely new versions. You agree
						to receive such updates (and permit Blancboard to deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Services.<br /> <br /> <b>12. Ending your
							relationship with Blancboard</b> <br /> The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Blancboard as set out below.<br /> If you
						want to terminate your legal agreement with Blancboard, you may do so by (a) notifying Blancboard at any time and (b) closing your accounts for all
						of the Services which you use, where Blancboard has made this option available to you. Your notice should be sent, in writing, to Blancboard address
						which is set out at the beginning of these Terms.<br /> Blancboard may at any time, terminate its legal agreement with you if:
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						(A) you have breached any provision of the Terms (or have acted in manner which clearly shows that you do not intend to, or are unable to comply
						with the provisions of the Terms); or<br /> (B) Blancboard is required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of the Services to you
						is, or becomes, unlawful); or<br /> (C) Blancboard is transitioning to no longer providing the Services to users in the country in which you are
						resident or from which you use the service; or<br /> (D) the provision of the Services to you by Blancboard is, in Blancboard's opinion, no longer
						commercially viable.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<br /> Nothing in this Section shall affect Blancboard's rights regarding provision of Services under Section 3 of the Terms.<br /> When these
						Terms come to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and liabilities that you and Blancboard have benefited from, been subject to (or which
						have accrued over time whilst the Terms have been in force) or which are expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this
						cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 17 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.<br /> <br /> <b>13.
							EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES</b> <br /> NOTHING IN THESE TERMS SHALL EXCLUDE OR LIMIT BLANCBOARD'S WARRANTY OR LIABILITY FOR LOSSES WHICH MAY NOT BE
						LAWFULLY EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OR THE
						LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR BREACH OF IMPLIED TERMS, OR INCIDENTAL OR
						CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, ONLY THE LIMITATIONS WHICH ARE LAWFUL IN YOUR JURISDICTION WILL APPLY TO YOU AND OUR LIABILITY WILL BE
						LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT
						THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot;. IN PARTICULAR, BLANCBOARD, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS DO

						BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH
						MATERIAL.<br /> NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM BLANCBOARD OR THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICES SHALL CREATE

						THE LIMITATIONS ON BLANCBOARD'S LIABILITY TO YOU SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT BLANCBOARD HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE
						POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.<br /> <br /> <b>16. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE OF BLANCBOARD </b><br /> <br /> <br /> <b>17.
							Other content</b> <br /> The Services may include hyperlinks to other web sites or content or resources, or may include information incorporated
						therefrom. Blancboard may have no control over any web sites or resources, or content therefrom, which are provided by companies or persons other
						than Blancboard. You acknowledge and agree that Blancboard is not responsible for the availability of any such external sites or resources, or
						content therefrom and does not endorse any advertising, products or other materials on or available from such web sites or resources. You
						acknowledge and agree that Blancboard is not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred by you as a result of the availability of those
						external sites or resources, or content therefrom, or as a result of any reliance placed by you on the completeness, accuracy or existence of
						any advertising, products or other materials on, or available from, such web sites or resources or content therefrom.<br /> <br /> <b>18.
							Changes to the Terms</b> <br /> Blancboard may make changes to the Terms from time to time. When these changes are made, Blancboard will make a new
						copy of the Terms available at http://www.blancboard.com/terms.html. You understand and agree that if you use the Services after the date on which
						the Terms have changed, Blancboard will treat your use as acceptance of the updated Terms.<br /> <br /> <b>19. General legal terms</b> <br />
						Sometimes when you use the Services, you may (as a result of, or through your use of the Services) use a service or download a piece of software
						or other content, which are provided by another person or company. Your use of these other services, software or content may be subject to
						separate terms between you and the company or person concerned. If so, the Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other
						companies or individuals.<br /> <br /> The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Blancboard and govern your use of the
						Services (but excluding any services which Blancboard may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior
						agreements between you and Blancboard in relation to the Services.<br /> <br /> You agree that Blancboard may provide you with notices, including
						those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Services.<br /> <br /> You agree that if Blancboard does not
						exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Blancboard has the benefit of under any applicable law),
						this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Blancboard's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Blancboard.<br />
						<br /> If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that
						provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be
						valid and enforceable.<br /> <br /> The Terms, and your relationship with Blancboard under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the State
						of Connecticut without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Blancboard agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
						located within the county of Hartford, Connecticut to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that
						Blancboard shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
